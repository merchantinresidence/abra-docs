# Abra Schema

The Abra schema is a core concept to running your promotions. If you've created a promotion in our embedded app, you've already interacted with the schema. This guide will walk you through how the schema works, how does it interact with your storefront, and what you can do with it.

## Getting started

```json
{
  "schema" {
    "all" {
      "dd1627cb-428e-4b7d-bc05-dd96cc6cb50a": {
        "type": "popup",
        "text": "20% APPLIED"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
